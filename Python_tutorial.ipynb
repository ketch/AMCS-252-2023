    "Hopefully this brief adventure has convinced you that Python is a worthwhile programming language.  Some of the reasons I chose Python as the language for this course (and other courses I teach) are:\n",
    "- Compared to lower-level languages like C, C++, and Fortran, Python code is easier to write and read (meaning fewer bugs!)\n",
    "- A huge number of available libraries means it is easy to get things done in Python without writing a lot of code yourself\n",
    "- Python is a general-purpose programming language, with features (like optional arguments with defaults) that lead to more elegant, maintainable code than what you can write with specialized languages like MATLAB.\n",
    "- Python is free and comes installed on most systems.  You can run this whole course with only a web browser and access to the internet.\n",
    "- It's easy to incorporate code written in other languages into your Python programs.\n",
    "- It's often easy to [parallelize existing scientific codes](http://numerics.kaust.edu.sa/papers/pyclaw-sisc/pyclaw-sisc.html) using Python.\n",
    "- All these advantages have made it [very](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/07/26/python-is-becoming-the-worlds-most-popular-coding-language) [popular](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/)\n",
