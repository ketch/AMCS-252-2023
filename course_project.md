# AMCS 252 Course Project

Requirements for the course project consist of 3 parts:

1. Proposal (20%)
2. Progress report (20%)
3. Presentation (60%)

## Proposal (due March 23rd)
For this part, you must write a 2-page proposal explaining:
  - The topic of your project, including a basic description and any equations or algorithms that you will focus on
  - What references you plan to use (paper(s), textbook(s), etc.)
  - What the expected results of the project are.  This should include both the concepts that you will understand and explain, as well as (in most cases) code that you will write.

The main purpose of the proposal is to ensure that the topic is appropriate and the scope is neither too simple nor too extensive/difficult.  A list of suggested
topics is given below, but you may choose your own.  The only restriction is that you cannot use a topic for which you are already getting credit
in another course (such as directed research or thesis work).

## Progress report (due April 20th)
This is a written report of no more than 4 pages, meant to help ensure that you're making adequate progress on the project.
You should explain ideas that you have learned so far, and describe any modifications you've had to make to the original project plan and scope.
It's also a good idea to include some preliminary numerical results (since you have hopefully made at least a preliminary implementation
of any algorithms involved).

## Presentation (last week of class)
You will give a presentation to the class which should take 25 minutes, leaving 5 minutes for questions.  The objective of the presentation is to teach
the topic of your project to the other students in the course.  In most cases, you should include computational results from your own code as illustrations
or examples.
